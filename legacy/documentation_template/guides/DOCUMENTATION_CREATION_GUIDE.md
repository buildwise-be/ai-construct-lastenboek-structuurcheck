## 🎨 **Content Creation Methodology**

### **Step 1: System Analysis & Research**

**Information Gathering:**
```bash
# Use codebase search to understand system components
codebase_search "How does the main processing pipeline work?"
codebase_search "What are the authentication mechanisms?"
codebase_search "What are the deployment procedures?"

# Read key documentation files
read_file "README.md"
read_file "SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md" 
read_file "API_REFERENCE.md"

# Analyze code structure
grep_search "class.*Processor" --type py
grep_search "def.*process" --type py
```

**Research Areas:**
- System architecture and components
- User workflows and use cases
- Technical implementation details
- Configuration and deployment procedures
- Troubleshooting and support processes
- Regulatory and compliance requirements

### **Step 2: Audience Analysis**

**Identify User Types:**
- **Business Users**: Need workflow guidance and business context
- **Developers**: Need API documentation and technical details
- **Administrators**: Need deployment and operational procedures
- **Compliance Teams**: Need regulatory framework and audit procedures

**Create User Personas:**
```yaml
Business_User:
  needs: ["Quick start guide", "Process workflows", "Results interpretation"]
  pain_points: ["Complex technical details", "Missing business context"]
  preferred_format: ["Step-by-step guides", "Visual workflows", "FAQ sections"]

Developer:
  needs: ["API reference", "Code examples", "Integration patterns"]
  pain_points: ["Incomplete API docs", "Missing code examples"]
  preferred_format: ["Code snippets", "Technical diagrams", "Implementation guides"]
```

### **Step 3: Content Structure Planning**

**Create Detailed Table of Contents:**
```markdown
# DETAILED_CONFLUENCE_TOC.md Template
