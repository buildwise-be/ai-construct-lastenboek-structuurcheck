## **DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE**

### **SECTION 1: PROJECT OVERVIEW & GOALS**

### **SECTION 2: PROCESS & TIMELINE**

**Instructions:**
- Extract all information related to project execution, phases, and scheduling.
- **2.1 Project Phases**: Logically divide the project into distinct phases (e.g., Phase 1: Planning, Phase 2: Execution, Phase 3: Review).
- **2.2 Detailed Timeline**: Create a Markdown table detailing key milestones and their deadlines.
- **2.3 Workflow**: Describe the step-by-step operational flow of the project. If possible, generate a simple Mermaid flowchart to visualize the process.

### **SECTION 3: OUTCOMES & RESULTS**

**Instructions:**
- Document the tangible outputs and performance of the project.
- **3.1 Final Deliverables**: List all final products, reports, or other outputs generated by the project.

- **3.3 Budget Summary**: Present a simple summary of the planned budget versus the actual expenditure.

### **SECTION 4: LESSONS LEARNED & NEXT STEPS**

**Instructions:**
- Synthesize feedback, analysis, and future plans.
- **4.1 Successes**: List the key successes and things that should be replicated in future projects.

## **QUALITY & FORMATTING RULES**

- **Language**: Use clear, direct, and professional language.
- **Jargon**: Avoid jargon and acronyms. If they are necessary, define them on their first use.
- **Formatting**: Use Markdown headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists extensively to ensure readability.
- **Visuals**: Where appropriate, use Markdown tables and Mermaid charts to present data and processes visually.
- **Tone**: Maintain an objective and informative tone.
- **Completeness**: Ensure every subsection of the four-part structure is completed. If information for a subsection is not available in the user's input, state "Information not provided." Do not leave sections blank.
