# DOCUMENTATION CREATION GUIDE
**How to Create Practical, Developer-First Technical Documentation**

## 📚 **Overview**

This guide documents a methodology for creating clear, practical, and maintainable technical documentation for complex systems. It favors a flexible, developer-first approach over rigid, enterprise-style structures.

---

## 🎯 **Documentation Philosophy**

### **Core Principles**
1.  **Document the Workflow**: Structure the documentation to follow the system's actual execution flow. Explain the *why* and *how* of each step in the process.
2.  **Code is the Foundation**: Base all explanations on the actual, implemented code. Use real code snippets to illustrate every key process.
3.  **Clarity Over Volume**: Prioritize clear, concise, and accurate information. A short, accurate document is better than a long, confusing one.
4.  **Developer-First, but Audience-Aware**: Write for a technical audience (developers, architects) first, but ensure the high-level summaries are accessible to all stakeholders.
5.  **Maintainability**: Create a structure that is easy to update as the project evolves. A workflow-based structure is naturally easier to maintain.

## 🏗️ **Recommended Documentation Structure**

Instead of a rigid, multi-section framework, start with a process-oriented flow. The structure we developed for the AI Form Filling system is an excellent template:

### **Process-Oriented Model**

**Section 1: Overview & Introduction**
- **Purpose**: High-level business context, system goals, and a summary of the core workflow.
- **Audience**: All stakeholders.

**Section 2: Technical Architecture & Workflow**
- **Purpose**: A detailed, step-by-step breakdown of the system's execution flow, from input to output. This is the core of the document.
- **Audience**: Primarily Developers, but also useful for technical stakeholders.
- **Structure**:
    - **2.1 High-Level Process Overview**: A numbered or bulleted list of the main stages (e.g., Layout Detection -> AI Analysis -> PDF Population).
    - **2.2 Detailed Step-by-Step Workflow**: A subsection for *each* stage identified above. Each subsection should include:
        - The name of the script/module responsible.
        - A clear explanation of what happens in this step.
        - **Relevant code snippets** that show the process in action.
    - **2.3 Component Architecture**: A summary of the key scripts and their roles.
    - **2.4 Important Technical Concepts**: Subsections for any complex but critical concepts (e.g., Coordinate Space Transformation, Local Vision Model details).

**Section 3: User Documentation**
- **Purpose**: Simple, clear instructions for running the system.
- **Audience**: End users, developers setting up the project.

**Section 4: Developer Documentation**
- **Purpose**: Reference for key internal functions and classes.
- **Audience**: Developers.
- **Best Practice**: Rename "API Reference" to **"Core Function Reference"** to avoid confusion with public-facing APIs.

**Section 5: Setup**
- **Purpose**: Instructions for setting up a local development environment.
- **Audience**: Developers.

**Section 6: Maintenance**
- **Purpose**: Covers recurring tasks required to keep the system up-to-date.
- **Audience**: System administrators, developers.

**Section 7: Limitations & Future Improvements**
- **Purpose**: A transparent look at what the system *doesn't* do and how it could be improved (e.g., Lack of OCR for scanned documents).
- **Audience**: Developers, technical stakeholders.

**Section 8: Troubleshooting**
- **Purpose**: Problem resolution for issues that were actually encountered during development.
- **Audience**: Support teams, administrators, developers.

**Section 9: Appendix**
- **Purpose**: A dedicated section for lengthy, supplementary materials that are referenced elsewhere in the document. This is the ideal place for full AI prompts, large configuration files, or detailed data schemas.
- **Audience**: Developers.

## 🎨 **Content Creation Best Practices**

### **1. Use an Appendix for Prompts and Large Configurations**
For systems that interact with AI or have complex configurations, place the full text of these assets in a dedicated Appendix at the end of the document. This keeps the main workflow sections clean while ensuring the full context is available.
- **Method**: In the main text, explain the purpose of the prompt or configuration and then refer the reader to the appendix (e.g., "The full text of this prompt can be found in the Appendix."). This is more reliable than embedding them in collapsible sections, which may not be supported by all Markdown viewers like Confluence.

### **2. Generalize Paths and User-Specific Information**
Never hardcode local file paths, usernames, or other user-specific information in the documentation.
- **Method**: Replace specific paths like `C:\Users\gr\project\...` with project-relative paths like `project/src/...`. This makes the documentation portable and useful for everyone.

### **3. Use Code to Explain, Not Just Decorate**
Every code snippet should have a purpose. It should directly illustrate the point being made in the text.
- **Template for Explaining with Code**:
    1.  **State the Goal**: "In this step, the system merges the text overlay with the original PDF."
    2.  **Show the Code**: Post the relevant code snippet.
    3.  **Explain the Code**: "Here, the `pypdf` library reads both the original and overlay files, the `merge_page()` function combines them, and the `writer.write()` function saves the final output."

### **4. Clarify Language and Scope**
Be explicit about the system's current capabilities.
- **Example**: "The system is currently configured to process **Dutch** language forms, but it can be easily adapted to other languages by modifying the AI prompt." This is clear, honest, and manages expectations.

## 🚀 **Simplified Implementation Plan**

Forget rigid timelines and word counts. Focus on a pragmatic, iterative approach:

1.  **Map the Workflow**: Whiteboard or list the core steps the system takes. This will become the backbone of your "Technical Architecture & Workflow" section.
2.  **Draft the Workflow with Code**: Write the detailed step-by-step section first. Pull the relevant code snippets from your source files as you go. This ensures the documentation is grounded in reality from the start.
3.  **Write the Surrounding Sections**: With the core workflow documented, write the easier sections like Overview, Setup, and User Documentation.
4.  **Review and Refine**: Read through the entire document. Does it flow logically? Is it easy to understand? Add the "Limitations" and "Troubleshooting" sections based on your development experience.
5.  **Share for Feedback**: Share the document with another developer. If they can understand the system from your document, you've succeeded.
