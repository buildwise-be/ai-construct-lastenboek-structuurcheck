# Meetstaat Inc. - Construction Document Analysis Tool

This tool provides an advanced analysis of construction specification documents (`Lastenboeken`) to identify misplaced tasks and organizational issues. It uses a combination of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Google's Gemini AI to provide a deep, contextual understanding of the documents.

## How it Works

The application follows a multi-step process to analyze construction documents:

1.  **OCR Processing:** The process starts with a PDF document, which is run through an OCR pipeline to extract the full text and identify the table of contents.
2.  **AI Analysis:** The full text is then analyzed by a `Generative Language Model` (Google Gemini 1.5 Flash). Unlike traditional methods that rely on keywords, this model understands the context and conceptual relationships between different sections.
3.  **Results UI:** The results are presented in a user-friendly web interface, where you can filter issues by their category and view the details of each issue.

## Features

-   **AI-Powered Analysis:** Leverages Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model to analyze the full text of construction documents.
-   **Contextual Understanding:** Goes beyond simple keyword matching to understand the conceptual relationships between different sections.
-   **Nuanced Issue Categorization:** Classifies issues into `Critical Misplacement`, `Poor Organization`, and `Suggestion for Improvement` for a more meaningful analysis.
-   **Interactive Web UI:** Provides a user-friendly interface to upload documents, view results, and filter issues.
-   **Summary Dashboard:** Offers a high-level overview of the analysis results, including the total number of issues per category.
